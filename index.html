        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
        <p>
          Understanding MBTA ridership patterns is essential for improving the efficiency and accessibility of public transportation in the Greater Boston area. 
          The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) plays a critical role in connecting communities, supporting economic mobility, and reducing urban congestion. 
          By analyzing how ridership fluctuates between peak and off-peak hours across different commuter rail lines, this project seeks to uncover meaningful insights that can 
          guide operational planning, scheduling decisions, and rider experience improvements.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Monitoring commuter rail usage offers valuable insight into broader social and economic behaviors, such as daily commuting trends, demand surges during rush hours, and 
          variability across weekdays. High ridership during peak hours may reflect concentrated commuting activity in urban cores, while off-peak patterns can highlight nontraditional 
          usage, such as leisure travel or flexible work schedules. Evaluating these shifts can help MBTA optimize resources, reduce service gaps, and better align capacity with rider needs.
          As noted in <a href="https://transitcenter.org/all-ridership-is-super-local/" target="_blank">TransitCenterâ€™s analysis</a>, ridership patterns are highly localized, shaped by neighborhood-level differences 
          in demographics, accessibility, and alternative transportation options.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Furthermore, a data-driven understanding of ridership patterns can help address pressing challenges like overcrowding, service reliability, and equitable access. 
          This analysis can inform not only real-time operational decisions but also long-term infrastructure investments, especially as public transit adapts to post-pandemic usage trends.
          Research such as that published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03611981241255020" target="_blank">Transportation Research Record</a> emphasizes the importance of timely, spatially-informed decision-making to improve service quality 
          and encourage ridership growth. By visualizing these dynamics through clear and interactive data visualizations, we aim to provide actionable insights that support MBTA ridership.

        <h2>Overview of OTP Ratio per Route (2024)</h2>

            <p>
              This horizontal bar chart provides a clear comparison of the average On-Time Performance (OTP) ratio across MBTA commuter rail routes in 2024.
              Routes like CR-Lowell and CR-Fairmount rank highest, suggesting consistent service delivery and fewer delays, which could reflect efficient scheduling,
              infrastructure quality, or lower congestion levels. On the other hand, routes such as CR-Middleborough and CR-Kingston display lower OTP ratios,
              indicating more frequent delays or inconsistencies that may negatively impact rider satisfaction. By visualizing these differences, this chart helps
              identify which routes are operating efficiently and which ones may require further attention, investment, or operational changes.
              These insights are essential for prioritizing improvements in service reliability and ensuring equitable, dependable transit access across the network.

        <h2>Weekly OTP Trends by Month</h2>
      
        <p>
            Following the route-level comparison of OTP ratios, this interactive line chart shifts the focus to temporal performance, 
            highlighting weekly trends in On-Time Performance (OTP) across each month in 2024. Users can interactively select individual months 
            to examine how consistent OTP was week to week. While routes like CR-Lowell perform reliably on average, this chart reveals that 
            even high-performing lines can experience monthly or seasonal fluctuations. For example, May and June show notable variability, 
            suggesting potential operational challenges or increased travel demand, whereas January and February remain stable with high OTP ratios. 
            This month-to-month analysis helps uncover periods of volatility that may require targeted service adjustments or resource planning.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Diving deeper into the week-by-week breakdown, it becomes clear that some months exhibit mid-month drops in OTP, which could correspond 
            to maintenance periods, staffing shortages, or external disruptions such as weather. For instance, in May, a pronounced dip in week three suggests a service disruption 
            or operational bottleneck, whereas the beginning and end of the month appear relatively stable. Similarly, November displays a sharp drop in the second or third week, 
            followed by a quick recovery. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In contrast, months like March and April display consistent OTP across all weeks, which may reflect effective scheduling and fewer external pressures. 
            February, while shorter in length, maintains some of the most consistent OTP values week to week, reinforcing its position as one of the most reliable months overall. 
            These insights allow transit authorities to isolate specific weeks that underperform, offering a more actionable lens than monthly averages alone.

        <h2>Geographic Maps</h2>
        <p>
            While previous charts explored ridership patterns through aggregated trends and time-based breakdowns, the following set of visualizations shifts the focus to a geographic perspective. 
            By mapping key performance metrics such as on-time performance, peak versus off-peak reliability, and cancellation rates across the MBTA commuter rail network, we gain valuable insight 
            into how service quality varies by route and location. These maps provide an intuitive, spatial understanding of operational reliability across the system.
        </p>

        <h3>On-Time Performance by Route</h3>
        <p>
            The map describes OTP ratio for each of the commuter rail lines. The user can hover over each of the lines to see the ratio, 
            represented as a percent, of how often each train arrives on time, as per the posted schedule. The data indicates the Lowell line is the strongest,
            with about 95.6% of arrivals being classified as on time, with the Middleborough/Lakeville line being least reliable at 85.9%. The legend indicates the color 
            associated with the percentage scales.

      <div class="chart-section">
        <h3>On-Time Performance During Peak vs. Off-Peak Hours</h3>
        <p>
            The map allows the user to click on each line to see the on-time percentages for both on-peak and off-peak hours. The data does not indicate that reliability is 
            greater or less in both off and on-peak hours, as the percentages are relatively similar for each line.

      <div class="chart-section">
        <h3>Cancellation Rate by Route</h3>
        <p>
            The map displays the cancellation rate for each line when the user hovers above the indicated line. The cancellation rate is low and is around 1% or 
            less for all lines.
