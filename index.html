        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
        <p>
          Understanding MBTA ridership patterns is essential for improving the efficiency and accessibility of public transportation in the Greater Boston area. 
          The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) plays a critical role in connecting communities, supporting economic mobility, and reducing urban congestion. 
          By analyzing how ridership fluctuates between peak and off-peak hours across different commuter rail lines, this project seeks to uncover meaningful insights that can 
          guide operational planning, scheduling decisions, and rider experience improvements.
        </p>

          Monitoring commuter rail usage offers valuable insight into broader social and economic behaviors, such as daily commuting trends, demand surges during rush hours, and 
          variability across weekdays. High ridership during peak hours may reflect concentrated commuting activity in urban cores, while off-peak patterns can highlight nontraditional 
          usage, such as leisure travel or flexible work schedules. Evaluating these shifts can help MBTA optimize resources, reduce service gaps, and better align capacity with rider needs.
          As noted in <a href="https://transitcenter.org/all-ridership-is-super-local/" target="_blank">TransitCenterâ€™s analysis</a>, ridership patterns are highly localized, shaped by neighborhood-level differences 
          in demographics, accessibility, and alternative transportation options.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Furthermore, a data-driven understanding of ridership patterns can help address pressing challenges like overcrowding, service reliability, and equitable access. 
          This analysis can inform not only real-time operational decisions but also long-term infrastructure investments, especially as public transit adapts to post-pandemic usage trends.
          Research such as that published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03611981241255020" target="_blank">Transportation Research Record</a> emphasizes the importance of timely, spatially-informed decision-making to improve service quality 
          and encourage ridership growth. By visualizing these dynamics through clear and interactive data visualizations, we aim to provide actionable insights that support MBTA ridership.

        <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
      
        <p>
            The dataset used in this project is a cleaned and curated version of the 
            <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b3a24561c2104422a78b593e92b566d5_0/explore" target="_blank">
              MBTA Commuter Rail Ridership data</a> for the year 2024, 
            prepared to support analysis of ridership trends across time and routes. 
            It contains 9,839 observations and 10 attributes.

        <h3>Overview of OTP ratio per route (2024)</h3>
        <img src="charts/otp_ratio_by_route_horizontal.png" alt="MBTA OTP Chart" width="700" />
        <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This horizontal bar chart provides a clear comparison of the average On-Time Performance (OTP) ratio across MBTA commuter rail routes in 2024. 
            Routes like CR-Lowell and CR-Fairmount rank highest, suggesting consistent service delivery and fewer delays, which could reflect efficient scheduling, infrastructure quality, or lower congestion levels. 
            On the other hand, routes such as CR-Middleborough and CR-Kingston display lower OTP ratios, indicating more frequent delays or inconsistencies that may negatively impact rider satisfaction. 
            By visualizing these differences, this chart helps identify which routes are operating efficiently and which ones may require further attention, investment, or operational changes. 
            These insights are essential for prioritizing improvements in service reliability and ensuring equitable, dependable transit access across the network.
