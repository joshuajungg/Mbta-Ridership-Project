        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
        <p>
          Understanding MBTA ridership patterns is essential for improving the efficiency and accessibility of public transportation in the Greater Boston area. 
          The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) plays a critical role in connecting communities, supporting economic mobility, and reducing urban congestion. 
          By analyzing how ridership fluctuates between peak and off-peak hours across different commuter rail lines, this project seeks to uncover meaningful insights that can 
          guide operational planning, scheduling decisions, and rider experience improvements.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Monitoring commuter rail usage offers valuable insight into broader social and economic behaviors, such as daily commuting trends, demand surges during rush hours, and 
          variability across weekdays. High ridership during peak hours may reflect concentrated commuting activity in urban cores, while off-peak patterns can highlight nontraditional 
          usage, such as leisure travel or flexible work schedules. Evaluating these shifts can help MBTA optimize resources, reduce service gaps, and better align capacity with rider needs.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Furthermore, a data-driven understanding of ridership patterns can help address pressing challenges like overcrowding, service reliability, and equitable access. 
          This analysis can inform not only real-time operational decisions but also long-term infrastructure investments, especially as public transit adapts to post-pandemic usage trends.
          By visualizing these dynamics through clear and interactive data visualizations, we aim to provide actionable insights that can support more sustainable and commuter-friendly transit solutions.

        <h2>Introduction of the Data</h2>
      
        <p>
          This analysis uses the MBTA Commuter Rail Ridership dataset from the 
          <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">MassDOT Open Data Portal</a>. 
          The dataset contains 9,839 rows and 13 columns, focusing specifically on Commuter Rail performance for the year 2024. 
          It includes information on service reliability, ridership by time of day, and performance indicators across various rail lines and stations. 
          The table below outlines the key attributes used in our analysis:
